DocHunter - A free code tool optimized for creating documentation standards
=============================================================

# What is DocHunter?
DocHunter is a free program for Microsoft Windows. It was developed by [Murilo Lima Alves (mlima.louveira@icloud.com)](https://github.com/mlimaalves) and published under GNU General Public License v3.0 (GNU GPLv3).
By December 2018, DocHunter final files were available for the following languages:
* pt-BR (Portuguese - Brazil).
* en-US (English - United States).
* es-MX (Spanish - Mexico).

DocHunter features mainly targets IT software teams: Developers, Testers, non-programmers and Information Systems audit. It is useful to create single files or generic sources documentation.

The C# language and XML interpretation are used by the application. The final documentation can be opened by any device, since the final files uses HTML, CSS Styles and JavaScript only. These files can be copied to a different machine, device or even be published as a website. 

Although DocHunter offers integration, it is important to notice that it is not a source code management tool (e.g. Azure DevOps, Team Foundation Server, and Tortoise) and cannot be used as a back-end for it. It is not a compiler and does not use engines to read source-codes. DocHunter uses RegEx (Regular Expressions) over comment blocks and shows source-codes in a more readable way.

Most of the features were created under IT case studies to be a general ease of use. The latest versions includes: Multiple projects support, Azure DevOps / Visual Studio Online Integration, customizable layouts/styles and a [Configuration Wizard (XMLWizard.exe)](https://github.com/mlimaalves/DevDocs_XMLWizard).
